   - Job titles and their exact wording
   - Employment dates, durations, and chronology

3. Make surgical corrections ONLY where factual information is wrong:
   - Preserve the improved descriptions and achievements

   - Keep the improved formatting and structure
   - Only correct objective factual errors

4. Output the corrected resume with these principles:
   - Facts must match the original resume exactly
   - Enhancements to descriptions should be preserved
